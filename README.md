### Hi there I'm Sam! 👋

Hello! I am a former 💲 sales professional with a passion for leveraging 💡 technology to drive business growth. Recently, I decided to expand my skillset by enrolling in and graduating from a coding bootcamp where I 📚 learned to master creating the same kinds of technology I used to sell.

As I move out of the sales world I will continue to bring my skill in 🗣 communication, relationship-building, and problem solving to my new career as a software engineer. I am excited about the opportunities ahead as I grow my technical expertise and I look forward to 🤝 connecting with like-minded professionals who share my passion for innovation and growth!

In my free time you can find me playing soccer, reading, or playing Super Smash Bros. Melee competitively!

Feel free to reach out with any and all questions. I would love to connect with you!

😄 Pronouns: he/him
